WormFreeWorld
=============

A simple Android app based on the classic memory game, with a couple of twists.  The computer chooses the initial card to be matched, and the player has a time limit to choose a match. There are levels for matching doublets, triplets, and quadruplets.
The app will be used to help raise money for the nonprofit Worm Free World, which funds research to combat parasitic worm infections.
